This class is a bi-product of a project, funded by Aquaveo, at The Ohio State University in 2015-2017. The home page for the Computational Hydrodynamics and Informatics Laboratory at OSU, and further information on the works of Dr. Ethan Kubatko's CHIL lab may be found [here](https://ceg.osu.edu/projects-software-computational-hydrodynamics-and-informatics-lab).

The repository focuses on a class for representing triangular, quadrangular, and mixed-element polygonal meshes for hydrodynamic domains. Research related to the original work is ongoing.

Connectivity representation for elements (faces) is Node1-Node2-Node3-Node4, where Node4==Node3 for triangular elements. The functionality for all methods are inspired by MATLAB's built-in 'delaunayTriangulation()' class.
